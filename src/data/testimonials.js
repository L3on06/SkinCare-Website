        comment: " Hi there! I just wanted to drop you a message because I've been so shocked at how well my skin is reacting to your products! I ordered a couple of sample size products to try as my skin is sensitive & spot prone, and NOTHING has worked this quickly before. Thank you so much for creating your beautiful, natural, organic, environmentally friendly skin care products. I can't wait to order them full size!",

        comment: "I appreciate the seriousness and wholesomeness of this brand. I’ve used brands like Dr Hauschka and Weleda for years but am pleased to have found a more local/ UK alternative. I use the Makeup Melt, the Rejuvenate Day Cream and have had samples of the exfoliator and serum. I’m impressed by the high quality ingredients, lovely natural scents from essential oils and plastic-free packaging.",

        comment: "Beautiful natural oil. I have been using this in the day and the rosehip one at night and given up on makeup! My skin feels amazing. I love that these are plastic free in their little metal bottles. I sourced them out specifically for that - bonus is that the oil and the company is lovely too. The only thing was, if you're looking for plastic free, they come with a plastic pump too which I wasn't expecting (though in hindsight I think it does say this in the listing) however it is useful and when I re-order I will just request now not to send one in my next order and reuse the ones I have. Product is brilliant, I would highly recommend",
